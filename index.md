# What is the tracker?

A fairly generic tracking system, designed to be connected to some kind of persistent
storage and some other kind of authentication system, allow a kind of spreadsheet view
with the data persisted, and different users seeing different data.

# Intended use

As a replacement for Excel for tracking project data, especially involving time, in an
environment that requires data to be kept confidential. So it's a bit like Google Docs,
but with a local install to deliver security, and a slightly more database like
structure.

# Features

 * Flexible, grid-based views
 * Fine-grained role-based permissions on views
 * Synchronous updates from other users
 * Full auditing and logging of changes
