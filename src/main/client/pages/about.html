  <h4>About the tracker</h4>

  <p>
    The tracker is a simple web application that enables you to collaborate on a secure
    spreadsheet/database-like data set. Although it has some similarity to Google Docs, it
    is designed more to accommodate tracking events in a research study. Some of its more
    distinctive features include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Support for multiple studies</li>
    <li>Multiple views within a single study, each showing different sets of attributes</li>
    <li>Attribute types include: dates, booleans, strings, and dropdowns</li>
    <li>Support for N/A values</li>
    <li>Fine-grained permissions on views and studies</li>
    <li>Full audit logging of all value changes within a study</li>
    <li>Export to Excel</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Release notes</h4>
  
  <h5>Version 2.0 &mdash; July 2nd 2015</h5>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Ported to Java-based build process and deployment</li>
    <li>Authentication and authorization through Apache Shiro</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h5>Version 1.2 &mdash; April 15th 2015</h5>

  <ul>
    <li>Changed grid to use Handsontable, which is much closer to Excel in style</li>
    <li>Attributes can be "pinned" for scrolling horizontally</li>
    <li>Rows can wrap over several lines of text</li>
    <li>Attribute columns can have a proportionate width set</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Known issues:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      There appears to be a memory leak when switching to and from the grid view. Performance 
      will eventually degrade. To overcome this, refresh the page: this will start from a 
      clean state.
    </li>
    <li>
      Scrolling behaviour on Firefox seems dirty, especially when using the scroll bar. 
      Chrome is probably cleaner. 
    </li>
  </ul>
