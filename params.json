{"name":"Tracker","tagline":"Generic research tracking system","body":"Tracker\r\n-------\r\n\r\nWhat is the tracker?\r\n====================\r\n\r\nA fairly generic tracking system, designed to be connected to some kind of persistent\r\nstorage and some other kind of authentication system, allow a kind of spreadsheet view\r\nwith the data persisted, and different users seeing different data.\r\n\r\nIntended use\r\n============\r\n\r\nAs a replacement for Excel for tracking project data, especially involving time, in an\r\nenvironment that requires data to be kept confidential. So it's a bit like Google Docs,\r\nbut with a local install to deliver security, and a slightly more database like \r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n * Flexible, grid-based views\r\n * Fine-grained role-based permissions on views\r\n * Synchronous updates from other users\r\n * Full auditing and logging of changes\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation and Launch\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to install and run tracker: using Docker or by installing it \r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nDocker\r\n--------\r\nDownload and install the latest version of [Docker](http://docker.com) and \r\nbuild the container.\r\n\r\n    sudo docker build -t tracker .\r\n\r\nThen you can launch it using the following:\r\n\r\n    sudo docker run -p 9999:9999 -i -t tracker\r\n\r\nManual installation\r\n-------------------\r\nTracker requires Java 8 and Maven 3.1+. Once the dependencies are in place, \r\nyou can build tracker using\r\n\r\n    mvn install\r\n\r\nThe WAR can be deployed on any web server. You can also test it using Jetty.\r\n\r\n    mvn -Djetty.port=9999 jetty:run\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether you use Docker or Maven/Jetty, the tracker will be running\r\nat http://localhost:9999. Use admin:admin to access the test data.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
